# About

Photo editing has become a very important part of our routine. It is actively used for a large variety of purposes ranging from professional, such as making movies, to casual, such as sharing on social media. Therefore, photo editing has become a very useful skill to have. However, it often takes a large amount of time to get perfect results. Moreover, some tasks, including colourizing, inpainting or increasing resolution, seem impossible to the majority of users.  Thus, there's a huge demand in providing such services to people. We provide our solution by utilising Machine Learning (GANs).
